# GREMLIN_PYTORCH
a pytorch version for GREMLIN, used to predict the protein contacts by coevolution method.

pytorch 1 is a bare_bare minimum version, you can treat this as a pytorch tutorial.
pytorch 2 version has some classes, you can also treat this as a pytorch tutorial but can learn advanced structure.
